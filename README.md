# Background
Food delivery services are gaining traction due to their convenience and conduciveness to social distancing. There is demand for such services among college students, however, university administrators take issue with the security implications of allowing non affiliate business employees with access to the campus. Recent startups have begun to provide univsersities with internally managed food delivery systems. An example of a prototype database (let's call it CampusEats) powering such a service is described in this repository's [DDL script](https://github.com/UnexceptedSpectic/campus-eats/blob/main/db-setup-script.sql).

# Objectives
- Update the CampusEats database to include a rating system for restaurants and delivery drivers. 
- Optimize indexing to increase query performance. 
- Create views to showcase restaurant and delivery driver ratings.
